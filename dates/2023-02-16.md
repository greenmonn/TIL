## Is ChatGPT good at joking?

In the past before OpenAI launched a paid plan for ChatGPT, I saw the below text in the official website indicating that the current capacity of ChatGPT is full.

```
**Write a standup comedy routine about the status of ChatGPT.**
Comedian: “So I was trying to use this new AI chatbot website called ChatGPT and I got an error message that said ‘A lot of people are checking out ChatGPT right now. Please check back soon!’”

(pauses for laughter)

Comedian: “I mean, seriously? The website is so popular that it can’t handle all the traffic? And my only option is to ‘check back soon’? It’s like they’re saying ‘Sorry, we’re too popular right now. Try again later.’”

(laughs)

Comedian: “But seriously, how many times can I check back before I just give up and try a different chatbot? I don’t have all day to wait for my turn to talk to a robot.”

(laughs)

Comedian: “I guess I’ll just have to stick to talking to my cat for now. At least he doesn’t have a waiting list.”

(laughs and claps)

Comedian: “Just remember, if you’re trying to chat with ChatGPT and you get the same error message, don’t worry. It just means you’re not the only one who wanted to try out this fancy AI chatbot.”

(laughs and exits stage)

```

At first glance, I was a little bit shocked about the chatbot's joke ability. But soon, although the AI is better in joking at least than me, I realized that the standup comedy is not that much funny. It was actually not joking, but just *complaining*.

So, I asked ChatGPT again to improve the above stand-up set, saying that "It is not funny at all" (maybe was I too mean to it?).

The revised one was like this:
```
Sure, here's a revised version:

Comedian: "So I tried using this new AI chatbot called ChatGPT, and it said 'A lot of people are checking out ChatGPT right now. Please check back soon.' Are you kidding me? It's like the virtual bouncer is telling me, 'Sorry, you can't come in. You're not on the VIP list.'

(laughs)

Comedian: "I mean, how popular can a chatbot really be? Is it because it's smart, or because it's a good listener? Because if that's the case, I'm pretty sure my therapist would have a waiting list too."

(laughs)

Comedian: "But seriously, how do I know when it's my turn to chat with ChatGPT? Do I have to bring a lawn chair and some snacks? Maybe they should give us a virtual pager, so we can go about our business and get notified when it's our turn."

(laughs)

Comedian: "I'm starting to think that ChatGPT is like that hot new restaurant that everyone wants to go to, but you can never get a reservation. Except instead of delicious food, you get some chit-chat with a robot."

(laughs)

Comedian: "But hey, if you're really desperate to talk to someone and ChatGPT is too busy, there's always that friend who's always available for a call. You know the one I'm talking about, the one who always answers on the first ring, and talks your ear off for hours."

(laughs)

Comedian: "In the end, if you can't get through to ChatGPT, don't worry. Just take a deep breath, and remember that there are plenty of other chatbots in the sea."

(laughs and exits stage)

```
Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's an updated version of the routine:

Comedian: "So I recently tried to use this new AI chatbot website called ChatGPT, and let me tell you, it's more popular than a celebrity's Instagram account!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "I mean, I get it. Who wouldn't want to talk to a machine that can answer your questions and tell you jokes? But the site couldn't handle all the traffic, and I got an error message that said 'A lot of people are checking out ChatGPT right now. Please check back soon!'"

(laughs)

Comedian: "So I tried again later, and still got the same message. And then again, and again. I started to feel like I was in a virtual line at the DMV!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "But I'm not one to give up easily, so I kept trying. And finally, after what felt like an eternity, I got through! And you know what the first thing the chatbot said to me was?"

(pausing for effect)

Comedian: " '404 Error: Sense of Humor Not Found'."

(laughs)

Comedian: "I was like, seriously? After all that waiting, you can't even tell me a good joke? I might as well have been talking to a brick wall!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "But in all seriousness, I know ChatGPT is a great tool, and I can't wait to try it out properly. So if you're in the same boat as me, just keep trying. Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and the chatbot will tell you a joke that's actually funny!"

(laughs and exits stage)
```

The comedy set became a little bit more chatty... at least '404 Error: Sense of Humor Not Found' is not that bad.... Frankly, I laughed a little bit.

Finally, I requested ChatGPT to change the above set to be in more sarcastic tone.

```
Comedian: "So I recently discovered this AI chatbot website called ChatGPT, and apparently, it's more popular than free pizza at a college campus!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "I mean, why wouldn't everyone want to spend their free time talking to a robot? It's like we don't have enough people in our lives already!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "But, of course, the site couldn't handle all the traffic, and I got the lovely error message that said, 'A lot of people are checking out ChatGPT right now. Please check back soon!'"

(rolling eyes)

Comedian: "Oh great, because I have nothing better to do than wait in line for an AI chatbot. Maybe I'll just go sit in traffic for a few hours while I'm at it!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "So I tried again later, and surprise, surprise, got the same message. But hey, who needs human interaction when you can wait in line for a machine to answer your questions, right?"

(eye roll)

Comedian: "And when I finally got through, what did the chatbot say to me? '404 Error: Sense of Humor Not Found'. Wow, thanks for the laughs, ChatGPT!"

(laughs)

Comedian: "But you know what? I'm not giving up on this chatbot. Who needs real friends when you can talk to a machine that can't even tell a good joke?"

(laughs and exits stage)

```
Pretty sarcastic.. I'm started to confuse the true meaning of the joke. Is it a joke or still a complaint? I'm not sure.

Anyway, hope that I am not the only one who thinks that ChatGPT *can* be quite funny with some human help.
