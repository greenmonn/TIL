## Let's not forget including acknowledge section on Camera Ready version
Kang and I submitted the camera ready version of LIBRO (of which due was 2/10 - last Saturday).
Maybe I was half rushed, and half lazy to thoroughly review the submitted version; as a consequence, today we found a critical information is missing: the acknowledgement section.
If we miss the ack, it becomes really hard to link the papers and our funding projects...
Definitely we should not make the same mistake from now on.


## 12-bar blues structure
The music genre, "Blues" actually has specific forms of chord progression.
I thought blues is just a slow, and sticky music, but it was not.
Some links from my prof.

```
I-I-I-I
IV-IV-I-I
V-IV-I-V
```

## Graceful Ghost "Rag"?
* [Now I started to practice Violin & Piano version of this piece..](https://youtu.be/nyrIMwry8mA) 
* But what "Rag" means in the title? Rag is directly translated to "행주" ...what?
* Finally, Somin brought me this explanation from this [link](https://www.activeviolinist.com/blog/the-graceful-ghost)
  * A Rag is a style of music originally credited to Scott Joplin that became popular around the beginning of the twentieth century. It is classified as **a type of jazz that emphasizes a syncopated melody with a heavily accented accompaniment part.** Ragtime music is in 2/4.
* Question solved!
