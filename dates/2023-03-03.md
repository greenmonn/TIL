## CC in email: "Carbon Copy"
While we (I and my labmates) were drinking in the Kang's housewarming party, from some reason, we started talk about email. And the new thing I learned was that the "CC" in email header means "Carbon Copy". I thought it was just an abbreviation of "Cross Check" or something like that. But it's not.

We also queried ChatGPT about the origin of the term "Carbon Copy", and the produced answer was:
```
The term "carbon copy" or "CC" is used in emails as an abbreviation for the traditional carbon paper copying process. Before the advent of electronic communication, people used carbon paper to create duplicate copies of handwritten or typed documents. Carbon paper had a carbon-coated side that transferred the ink or pencil marks to the second sheet of paper placed beneath it. This method allowed people to make multiple copies of the same document without having to retype it every time.

In email, the CC field allows the sender to send a copy of the email to another person or group of people in addition to the primary recipient. This is similar to the traditional carbon copying process where a copy of the letter was sent to another person. The recipient of the CC'd email can see who else received the email and the contents of the message.

In summary, the term "carbon copy" in email is used to refer to the process of making a duplicate copy of a message or document, which is similar to the traditional carbon paper copying process used in the past.

and it was verified true by one of my labmates (sorry, I forgot exactly who). So, I learned at least one thing new today.
